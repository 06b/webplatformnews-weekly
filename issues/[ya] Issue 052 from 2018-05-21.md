1. **Improving the accessibility of `<ins>` and `<del>` elements with visually-hidden text**

   The `<ins>` element represents an addition to the document, while the `<del>` element represents a removal from the document. These elements, which can contain text and entire paragraphs (`<p>` elements), have [two additional content attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/edits.html#attributes-common-to-ins-and-del-elements): `cite` (the URL that explains the change), and `datetime` (the time and date of the change).

   Since `<ins>` and `<del>` elements aren’t announced by most screen readers, you can use the CSS `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to add visually-hidden text that indicates the start and end of the inserted/deleted content. Note that this feature could become an annoyance if overused.

1. **Avoid using the names of built-in form properties with the `name` content attribute**

   When naming form controls, avoid names such as `"method"`, `"action"`, and `"children"`, which can cause bugs and security issues [as a result of DOM clobbering](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#naming-form-controls:-the-name-attribute) (browsers add `name`s and `id`s of form controls as properties to the `form` object; see the second note). Although named form controls can be accessed directly on the `form` object, a better approach is to use the form’s `.elements` collection:

1. **Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test makes debugging Googlebot easier**

   When testing a web page with Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test, the “Page loading info” section contains a list of page resources that couldn’t be loaded, as well as a JavaScript console with the warnings and errors that were logged during page load.

   The test result page also includes an above-the-fold screenshot of the web page (as “seen” by Googlebot smartphone). If you need a full-page screenshot (of one of your *own* web pages), use the [“Fetch as Google” tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6066468?hl=en) instead. You can read about the limitations of Googlebot’s web rendering service in [weekly issue #41](https://github.com/simevidas/webplatformnews-weekly/blob/e3766de2f9910660b81b15a56aed17ac147014a0/issues/%5Byl%5D%20Issue%20041%20from%202018-03-05.md).
