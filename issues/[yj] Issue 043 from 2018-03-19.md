1. **Browsers assign a heuristic freshness lifetime to resources that are missing caching headers**

   A resource’s [freshness lifetime](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2) is usually set explicitly by the web server via the `max-age` directive in the HTTP `Cache-Control` response header (or alternatively, the `Expires` response header). During this period, the resource is “fresh“ and can be used by the browser’s cache without further validation (without contacting the origin server). After that period passes, the resource becomes stale, and the browser needs to revalidate it by sending a conditional request with an `If-Modified-Since` (or similar) header.

   However, if the web server does *not* set a resource’s freshness lifetime explicitly, the browser assigns a heuristic freshness lifetime to the resource, equal to 10% of the time since the resource was last modified (`Last-Modified` response header value). (Firefox additionally caps this value to 1 week.)

   Hence, omitting caching headers from a response does not prevent caching; it merely hands control over to the browser, which is not desirable: “At a minimum, you should be including `no-store` to prevent caching or `max-age=<seconds>` to indicate how long content should be considered fresh.”

1. **Ambient light and proximity events to be disabled in Firefox**

   Due to various [privacy issues](https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/stealing-sensitive-browser-data-with-the-w3c-ambient-light-sensor-api/), Mozilla plans to disable the [`devicelight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceLightEvent), [`deviceproximity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceProximityEvent), and `userproximity` events in Firefox later this year. The other device sensor events, `deviceorientation` and `devicemotion`, cannot be disabled for now since they’re used by libraries such as the WebVR polyfill. The overall long-term plan is to replace device sensor events with (privacy-aware) [Generic Sensor-based APIs](https://twitter.com/w3cdevs/status/976094070685798400). (Generic Sensor-based Motion Sensors have recently been [cleared for shipping](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/r8iKkTXftm4/8iBn0c2UAAAJ) in Chrome.)

1. **Bookmarklet that sends a web page’s serialized DOM to Nu HTML Checker**

   W3C’s HTML validator (“[Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)”) can check a web page’s HTML source code for errors such as disallowed elements and attributes, missing attributes, invalid attribute values, and encoding issues. In order to check elements and attributes that have been added (or modified) dynamically via JavaScript, you can use Steve Faulkner’s bookmarklet, which serializes the DOM of the current web page and sends it to Nu HTML Checker via a POST request.
