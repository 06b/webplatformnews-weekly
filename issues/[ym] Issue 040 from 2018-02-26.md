1. **Presentation API vs. Remote Playback API**

   The [Presentation API](https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/) allows web apps to render a web page on a second screen (“presentation display”), e.g., a projector connected with an HDMI cable or a smart TV connected wirelessly with Chromecast. The presented web page (“presentation page”) can exchange messages with the presenting web page (“controller page”) via the `navigator.presentation.receiver` API (this is called 1-UA mode because the browser renders both web pages locally and only sends the result of rendering the presentation page to the second screen).

   The [Remote Playback API](https://w3c.github.io/remote-playback/) allows web apps to render media content on a remote playback device (smart TV, wireless speaker, etc.) “without the complexity of the Presentation API.” For example, if the web page invokes the `remote.prompt()` method on a `<video>` element, the user is requested to select a remote playback device for the video.

   Both APIs are supported in Chrome (the latter is only functional on Android) and in development in Safari, while Firefox’s Presentation API implementation is currently disabled.

1. **Don’t use CSS to reorder table content**

   It is possible to reorder a table with CSS alone, by providing each row’s sorting data via inlined custom properties (e.g., `<tr style="--order-by-views: 123">`) and then using this data to compute the row’s `order` value inside a `:checked` style rule  (the table is reordered when the user clicks on a checkbox label). 
   
   However, this approach should be avoided due to its accessibility issues: the `order` property reorders the content visually, but not for keyboard or screen reader users. Reordering a table represents dynamic content, not styling, so it should instead be performed in JavaScript, by dynamically rearranging the table rows in the DOM.

   Another thing to watch out for is that applying a `display` value to a table element (e.g., `display: flex` on `<tbody>`) overrides that element’s semantic meaning. This issue can be avoided by [reaffirming the element’s semantics with the appropriate ARIA table role](http://adrianroselli.com/2018/02/tables-css-display-properties-and-aria.html) (e.g., `<tbody role="rowgroup">`).

1. **Browserslist’s default browsers have changed**

   If you use Autoprefixer in your project but don’t specify the project’s supported browsers via a Browserslist config (`.browserslistrc` file or `"browserslist"` key in the project’s package.json), Autoprefixer will fall back to Browserslist’s default config (the default target browsers) to determine which CSS vendor prefixes to generate. (Note that Browserslist is also used by [Babel’s `env` plugin and some other tools](https://github.com/ai/browserslist-example).) This set of default browsers has changed in Autoprefixer 8, based on Browserslist’s updated default config, which is now `> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead`. The two changes are:

   * Browsers with at least 0.5% of global market share are now included in the defaults (down from 1%). Notably, this change reintroduces the desktop version of Chrome 49 (the last version of Chrome supported on Windows 7) and iOS Safari 10.0 (released in September 2016).

   * IE10 and the BlackBerry browser are now labelled “dead” and removed from the defaults. “Dead browsers” are browsers with less than 1% of global market share that don’t receive security updates. Note that IE11 remains in the defaults.

   Side note: after updating Autoprefixer to version 8, you can run `npx autoprefixer --info` in your project’s directory to get the full list of supported browsers (the project’s target browsers).
