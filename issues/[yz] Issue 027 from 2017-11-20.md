1. Gotcha: “When you use a 301 or 302 redirect, the browser will change the method on the redirect to be a GET request, even if the original method was a POST request.” Use the 307 and 308 status codes instead if you need to retain the method, but note that the Nginx web server currently doesn’t support 308.

1. Google Search will soon start ignoring AMP pages that don’t include the same content as the (original) canonical page, which is required by their policy. This measure is in response to websites that create “teaser” AMP pages with minimal content and “See the full article at …” links.

1. Subclassable `EventTarget` constructor ([spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-eventtarget)) has shipped in Chrome Canary and Firefox Nightly. This allows web apps to create custom objects that inherit the standard DOM API for adding event listeners and dispatching events.
