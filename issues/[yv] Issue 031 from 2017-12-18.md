1. The Block Formatting Context (BFC; see [№ 941](https://webplatform.news/issues/2017-08-08#block-formatting-context)) **prevents margin collapsing** (see [№ 923](https://webplatform.news/issues/2017-07-05#collapsing-margins)) between an element and its children. You can apply `overflow: auto` to an element to establish a new BFC, but note that this property has side effects (“in certain scenarios you might find that you get an unwanted scrollbar, or that shadows are clipped”).

1. The WHATWG have created **new legal and governance policies** that aim to “enable more people to collaborate on Living Standards” ([most notably Microsoft](https://twitter.com/jacobrossi/status/940259873161228288)). Among other things, a new Steering Group that consists of representatives from the four major browser engines, will resolve disputes when there is sustained disagreement about a feature in a Living Standard.

1. New notes that describe the Web Storage APIs, have been [added to the HTML Standard](https://github.com/whatwg/html/commit/a39012210e708fcc3a7109284301e7f040c6fd32) (the first “Note” block in each of the following sections is new): [`Storage` interface](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-storage-interface), [`window.sessionStorage`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-sessionstorage-attribute), [`window.localStorage`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-localstorage-attribute), [`StorageEvent` interface](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-storageevent-interface). Btw, these types of notes are called “**domintro blocks**.”  

1. Mozilla ran a study to determine whether Firefox’s Tracking Protection feature breaks websites. The results showed that when users enabled Tracking Protection, they reported *fewer* problems with websites. This is most likely due to **tracking scripts slowing down web pages**.

1. “idb” is a library that wraps the IndexedDB API in promises, which makes it a good fit for async functions. For example, the **`await transaction.complete;` statement** waits for a transaction to complete, and the `await store.getAll()` expression returns all objects in the store.

1. The HTML Standard now specifies the **`autocapitalize` attribute**. The definition is based on the implementations in iOS Safari and Chrome for Android. Mobile browsers automatically capitalize the first letter of sentences inside `text` and `search` inputs. A web page can set the `<input autocapitalize="none">` attribute to disable this behavior.
