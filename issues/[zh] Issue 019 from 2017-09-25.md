1. **Every person experiences temporary disabilities**  
It’s less important that “about 15% of the world’s population lives with some form of disability.” What matters is that everyone has a disability at least sometimes, due to factors such as strong sunshine, a bumpy train, alcohol, or sleepiness.

1. **Phishing with an EV certificate**  
James Burton explains how he created a proof of concept of using an EV certificate to make a phishing website look legitimate. If a website has an EV certificate, Safari displays the company name *instead of* the URL in the address bar.

1. **Mozilla now reviews Firefox add-ons automatically**  
“Add-ons built on the WebExtensions API will now be automatically reviewed. This means, we will publish add-ons shortly after uploading. Human reviewers will look at these preapproved add-ons, prioritized on various risk factors that are calculated from the add-on’s codebase and other metadata.”

1. **Samsung Internet’s browser engine is somewhat old**  
Starbuck’s new web app (in beta) isn’t recognized as a PWA in Samsung Internet (there is [no 🞢 icon in the address bar](https://twitter.com/samsunginternet/status/911193630928449536)), because its service worker uses JavaScript features that aren’t yet supported in that browser. The current version of Samsung Internet (5.4) is based on Chromium 51 (from June 2016), so it doesn’t support the newer JavaScript features (ECMAScript 2016+) such as async functions. Hence, it’s a good idea to transpile your service worker down to ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

1. **Axis Praxis**  
This is a collection of interactive demos for variable fonts, and it can be tried out in Chrome Canary and [Safari 11 on macOS High Sierra](https://twitter.com/axis_praxis/status/912448849360408582). Notably, “Noboto Flex” lets you adjust the size of [ascenders](http://ilovetypography.com/typography-terms/typography-terms-a/) and descenders, and “Dunbar” the x-height. (Click on a heading or paragraph, and then use the “Font variation” panel on the right to update that element’s CSS `font-variation-settings` property value.)
