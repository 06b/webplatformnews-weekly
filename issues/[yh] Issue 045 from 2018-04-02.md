1. **CSS Snapshot 2018 informs browsers which features are approved for shipping**

   New CSS features are proposed and developed in separate modules with varying levels of stability. [CSS Snapshot 2018](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-2018/) lists the CSS modules that are considered stable (and hence, ready for shipping). In general, browsers are invited to ship a CSS feature once its specification reaches the “Candidate Recommendation” phase (CR). In exceptional cases, the CSS Working Group approves individual “pre-CR” features for shipping (e.g., [`conic-gradient()`](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/971813134246825987)). These features are [listed in the snapshot](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-2018/#experimental) (the list is still a work in progress).

   I recommend accessing CSS modules through [drafts.csswg.org](https://drafts.csswg.org/); this page lists all the editor’s drafts published by the CSS Working Group. The “Current Work” label identifies the most relevant specification for CSS modules that have attained multiple levels:

1. **Serving unbundled JavaScript modules comes at a performance cost**

   With next month’s release of Firefox 60, all major browser engines will include support for module scripts (`<script type="module">`). Websites can already use this feature to serve unbundled JavaScript modules (a fallback can be provided via a [`<script nomodule>` element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#script-nomodule-example)). However, some tests indicate that the runtime cost of loading module scripts is significant; if you’re considering this pattern, make sure to keep an eye on performance (e.g., with Lighthouse’s “JavaScript boot-up time” and “Main thread work breakdown” diagnostics).

   Side note: there is a possibility that [JavaScript bundles could be replaced by web packages](https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/979900188528541696) in the future.

1. **The WordPress AMP plugin will make it possible to convert entire websites to AMP**

   The WordPress content management system is used by roughly [30% of websites](https://wptavern.com/wordpress-now-used-on-30-of-the-top-10-million-sites) on the Web. Unfortunately, WordPress themes and plugins can [drastically reduce the loading performance](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/free-faster/) of websites, and “WordPress itself also hasn’t enforced any significant house rules up to now.”

   Google is partnering with Automattic et al. to [bring canonical AMP to WordPress](https://vip.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/first-class-amp-experience/); the WordPress AMP plugin will add support for “AMP Canonical mode” in version 0.7, which will enable converting entire WordPress websites to AMP. This could potentially make AMP “a new standard for mobile experiences in WordPress.”
