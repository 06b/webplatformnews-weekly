1. **The goal of the Accessibility Object Model (AOM)**

   Form controls (`<input>`, `<select>`, etc.) can only be styled to a certain degree in browsers, so some web apps re-implement them with HTML and CSS. In order to make these custom implementations accessible, ARIA attributes have to be used, which isn’t ideal, because it requires writing to the DOM repeatedly, and using `id` attributes with unique values to declare relationships between elements. The Accessibility Object Model is an upcoming JavaScript API that aims to make this easier, by allowing web apps to define an element’s semantics via a `this.accessibleNode` object instead of ARIA attributes.

   On WebPageTest’s website, the `/easy` path loads the useful “Simple Testing” interface, which defaults to a “Mobile - Emerging Markets” profile (it uses a connection that is even slower than “slow 3G”), and includes a checkbox for running Chrome’s Lighthouse audit (normally located in the “Chrome” tab of the advanced settings).

1. **Animating blur is not efficient**

   Animating the CSS `filter: blur()` value should be avoided, because it’s not efficient. The problem is that the CSS animation “promotes” the element, which in turn causes the (“inherently expensive”) blur effect to be applied by the GPU *every frame*, blowing the 16-ms frame budget. For this same reason, animating a blurred element (e.g. its `opacity`) is inefficient in general. However, an efficient blur animation can be emulated via a hack that involves creating multiple versions of the element at different blur stages (different `blur()` values), and then cross-fading between them, by animating the `opacity` value of their parent elements. (The wrappers are needed to prevent the blurred elements from getting promoted.)
