1. **Using variable fonts today is problematic**

   Variable fonts are supported in Chrome, Safari, and the next version of Edge (Firefox’s implementation is still disabled by default). A single variable font file can be used to render a typeface at many different weights. For example, the [Source Sans Roman variable font](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro/releases), which can be reduced to 29 KB by converting it to WOFF2 and subsetting it to around 400 characters, supports hundreds of individual weights (values `200` to `900`).

   However, using variable fonts today is tricky. It is possible to load a variable font under a different `font-family` name (e.g., `SourceSansVariable`) for browsers that support it, but the main issue is that not all of these browsers support `font-weight` in conjunction with variable fonts, which effectively means that for each selector that contains a `font-weight` declaration, you would have to reset `font-weight` inside a `@supports` rule and set that weight via the lower-level `font-variation-settings` property instead. For example:

   ```css
   .button {
     font-weight: 900;
   }

   @supports (font-variation-settings: "wght" 900) {
     .button {
       font-weight: normal;
       font-variation-settings: "wght" 900;
     }
   }
   ```

1. **Creating deep copies of objects**

   `Object.assign({}, obj)` and `{...obj}` can be used to create copies of objects. These copies are shallow, which means that if the original object references other objects (via its properties), these referenced objects are *not* copied. (As a result, the original object and the copy reference the same objects.)

   `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` can be used to create a deep copy of an object, with some limitations: this approach cannot be used in situations where the original object references a regular expression, JavaScript set, or any other type of object that isn’t a plain object or array, since these types of objects can’t be serialized to JSON.

   Certain Web APIs create “structured clones” (effectively, deep copies of objects, except that “methods and prototypes are not cloned”). Surma has written several small utility functions for creating deep copies of objects that use these APIs, and he has also [started a discussion](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/3414) about making the “structured clone” algorithm available directly via a standard global function.

1. **A Shadow DOM polyfill with caveats**

   One of the main advantages of Shadow DOM is style encapsulation (style rules defined outside of a shadow tree do not apply to elements inside the shadow tree, and vice versa). The Web Components polyfill suite includes a Shadow DOM polyfill, but it requires [manual setup](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs#shadowdom-css-is-not-encapsulated-out-of-the-box-) and provides limited style encapsulation (outside styles still apply to elements inside the shadow tree).

   Based on [Chris Coyier’s idea](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/882684638526832642) from last year, Andrea Giammarchi has created an out-of-the-box [2 KB polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/attachshadow) for the `attachShadow` method that uses `<iframe>` elements to provide style encapsulation in browsers that don’t support Shadow DOM (Firefox, Edge, IE), which works reasonably well for simple scenarios.
