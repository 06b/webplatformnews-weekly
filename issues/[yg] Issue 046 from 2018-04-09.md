1. **Monitoring all image loading errors on the page via a single event handler**

   When an image fails to load, an `error` event fires at the `<img>` element, but this event does not bubble up the DOM tree. However, since events go through a [capturing phase](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#introduction-to-dom-events) before reaching their target, it’s possible to monitor all image loading errors on the page via a single event handler (e.g., on the `document` object or `<body>` element), by setting the event handler’s `capture` option to `true` (the optional third argument to the `addEventListener` method, which defaults to `false`).

1. **Add space between clickable elements to make touch scrolling easier**

   Activating small targets can be a problem for some users (e.g., users with hand tremors and limited dexterity) and in some situations (e.g., in public transport); it’s recommended that clickable elements (e.g., buttons and links) are [at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels](https://w3c.github.io/wcag21/understanding/target-size.html) (a larger size is recommended for frequently-used controls).
   
   However, if touch targets are too large and close together, that can cause unintentional clicks during touch scrolling. If your web page contains a list of clickable elements, make sure that there is sufficient space between them to reduce the likelihood of accidental clicks.

1. **Deactivating conditional styles with the Feature Queries Manager extension**

   CSS feature queries ([`@supports` at-rules](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional/#at-supports)) allow websites to include conditional styles for browsers that support specific CSS features. Feature Queries Manager is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that enables deactivating these conditional styles by toggling the individual feature queries on the page. This can be useful for [testing no-support scenarios](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/988086082179862531), e.g., inspecting the page layout when `display: grid` isn’t supported.
