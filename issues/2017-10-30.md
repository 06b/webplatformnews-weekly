1. **“Add to home screen” in Firefox**

   Firefox Nightly is the latest Android browser with an “Add to home screen” feature for Progressive Web Apps. The feature is available via an [icon button in the URL bar](https://i.imgur.com/5XGByWm.png) (Samsung Internet has a similar button). When a web app is launched from the home screen, and the user taps an external link, it is opened in a Custom Tab ([Chrome does the same](https://github.com/simevidas/webplatformnews-weekly/blob/43ff6f6627e47f208cd9211892f0da422d0a2d57/issues/2017-08-21.md)).

1. **Content Blockers in third-party iOS browsers**

   Sören Hentzschel reports that in the latest version of iOS, third-party browsers can now implement Content Blockers, a feature that was limited to Safari until now. Mozilla’s iOS browsers (Firefox and Firefox Focus) have started using this feature to provide options for blocking trackers (Mozilla’s Tracking Protection).

1. **“Leave secure cookies alone”**

   For legacy reasons, secure cookies can be set—although not overwritten—from non-secure origins. To protect against potential man-in-the-middle attacks, this legacy behavior can be disabled by using cookie prefixes. If that’s not an option, Sjoerd Langkemper recommends *not deleting* secure cookies on logout: “Instead of deleting the cookie, write some garbage into it. By letting the cookie exist, it is protected from being overwritten.”

1. **Trusted Web Activities**

   Google announced Trusted Web Activities at Chrome Dev Summit 2017. This feature is available in Chrome Canary for Android, and it allows a native app to render its own website in fullscreen mode via the user’s preferred browser.

1. **WebPageTest retires “Emerging Markets” label**

   WebPageTest no longer uses the label “Emerging Markets” for the 400 Kbps (with 400 ms of latency) 3G connection, which is the default connection in the [Simple Testing interface](https://github.com/simevidas/webplatformnews-weekly/blob/1df48797b61d763c863eb3230160d8371eb2c0be/issues/2017-10-16.md), and which Alex Russell considers the “[real-world baseline network configuration](https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/).” Instead, this emulated connection is now simply called “3G Slow” (the previous connection with that name has been removed).
