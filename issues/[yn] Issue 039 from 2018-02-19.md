1. **Non-versioned external libraries cannot be protected with Subresource Integrity (SRI)**

   The `<script integrity>` attribute contains “a cryptographic hash of the representation of the resource the author expects to load.” When a web page provides this hash for one of its external libraries, the browser verifies that the fetched script matches the hash before executing the JavaScript it contains. This works well with versioned libraries (e.g., https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js) since they never change and thus correspond to a fixed hash.

   Unfortunately, some popular widgets (Disqus, Twitter, etc.) load non-versioned libraries (e.g., https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js) that cannot be protected with the `integrity` attribute since they’re expected to change over time (which changes their hash). Last month, a non-versioned third-party library for an accessibility widget was infected with malicious code that started dynamically loading a cryptominer on thousands of websites (incl. government websites).

   If you can, load versioned libraries and protect them with the `integrity` attribute. For example, CDNJS (a FOSS CDN powered by Cloudflare) provides a “Copy Script Tag with SRI” option. (Note: This option is [not available on the search results page](https://github.com/cdnjs/new-website/issues/152).)

   If you must load a non-versioned library, you can mitigate the risk with a Content Security Policy (CSP) that prevents loading libraries from untrusted domains.

1. **AMP Project experiments with JavaScript in web workers**

   The AMP project plans to (experimentally) implement a feature that would allow AMP pages to run custom JavaScript code inside sandboxed web workers. Their primary motivation is to allow JavaScript in AMP (currently not allowed) while ensuring that it doesn’t block the main thread and thus doesn’t degrade the user experience (e.g., with     scroll jank).

   According to [the proposal](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/13471), an AMP page would declare an off-main-thread script via the new `<amp-script>` element. This script would run in a sandboxed worker, which would include a “worker DOM” with mutation APIs that AMP would forward to the page as mutation requests (via `postMessage`). AMP would then perform these mutations on the real DOM, after sanitizing the requests (e.g., mutation requests would have to be tied to user gestures). The page would also be able to inline server-side-rendered HTML markup inside the `<amp-script>` element to ensure that the script doesn’t impact its “first contentful paint” time.

   Notably, this would allow AMP pages to implement their own, custom UI components (e.g., using a JavaScript framework such as Preact) instead of being limited to AMP’s predefined web components (which would effectively become optional). Rick Byers notes that “[there’s no good reason this pattern needs to be AMP-specific](https://twitter.com/RickByers/status/963563530875260928).” If this experiment proves successful, AMP could become the first framework to apply this pattern at scale.
