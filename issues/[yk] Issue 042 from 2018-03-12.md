1. **Browser vendors opposed to declarative Shadow DOM**

   Shadow DOM is an imperative JavaScript API ([`attachShadow` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow)). A declarative version of this feature ([proposal](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Declarative-Shadow-DOM.md)) would allow web apps to declare an element’s shadow tree in HTML markup without JavaScript (e.g., via a `<shadowroot>` element). Such a feature would enable server-side rendering, and make it easier to use scoped CSS (style encapsulation) and nest shadow trees, among other things.

   However, adding this feature would require updating the HTML parser, specifically adding a new “[parser macro](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/510#issuecomment-370980398).” At a recent web components meeting, it was decided to *not* move forward with this proposal (“we are not [motivated] to update the parser only for supporting declarative Shadow DOM”). Diego Ferreiro Val, who participated in the meeting, writes that it’s up to developers to convince implementers that this proposal (with whatever modifications) is worth pursuing.

1. **Browser extension for reporting annoying modal dialogs to Mozilla**

   Mozilla is experimenting with a popup blocker for annoying modal dialogs (“we’re planning to train a classifier to detect them automatically without having a full block list”). Use [this browser extension](https://github.com/ehsan/popup-reporter) to report web pages with inappropriate modal dialogs to Mozilla.

1. **Non-AMP pages in Google’s Top Stories carousel are still a long way off**

   [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095078/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-page-announcement-standard-web-packaging-urls): “Publishers that support AMP show up in Google’s top stories carousel, which means a flood of traffic. It’s a huge incentive to support AMP.”

   The AMP Project has outlined a set of proposed web features (listed in [this overview](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/web-standards-related-to-amp.md)) that need to be standardized and implemented in browsers before Google can start including non-AMP pages in the Top Stories carousel on search results pages.
   
   Paul Bakaus invites everyone to [contribute to this effort](https://twitter.com/pbakaus/status/971934217297739777). However, the standardization process is going to take a while and, according to Malte Ubl (tech lead of the AMP Project), does not yet have a timeline.
