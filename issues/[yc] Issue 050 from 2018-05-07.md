1. **The default credentials mode of the Fetch API has been changed to `'same-origin'`**

   The Fetch Standard has [changed the default credentials mode](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/commit/811575d6889026c68d55a327f79198dccfea403c) (from `'omit'`) to `'same-origin'` for requests initiated via the `fetch()` method, which means that cookies are now sent with same-origin requests, by default. This is an “ergonomic change for developers,” which aligns the Fetch API with other web platform features (XHR, preload, etc.).

   This new default will help prevent unintentional double-downloads (when fetching preloaded resources) and HTTP/2 connections (“[non-credentialed requests require another connection](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2557#issuecomment-295309876)”). Until this change widely supported (it’s shipping in Firefox and Chrome in July), you can [set the credentials mode manually](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#example-cors-with-credentials) (the `credentials: "same-origin"` option) to ensure that your `fetch()` calls perform credentialed requests in all browsers.

1. **CSS flexible length values between `0` and `1`, and `0fr` and `1fr` are valid but not recommended**

   In flexbox layouts, the `flex-grow` property can be used to distribute the free space in a flex container between the individual flex items. By default (the value `1`), all flex items grow by the same amount. The CSS Flexbox specification now includes a [note that recommends against using `flex-grow` values between `0` and `1`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox/#flex-property): “for example, using `1` and `2` is usually better than using `0.33` and `0.67`, as they’re more likely to behave as intended if items are added, removed, or line-wrapped.”

   In grid layouts, flexible lengths (`fr` unit) can be used to define flexible tracks, which receive the leftover space in a grid container (in proportion to their flex factor). The CSS Grid specification now includes a [note that recommends against using flexible length values between `0fr` and `1fr`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#fr-unit): “for example, using `1fr` and `2fr` is usually better than using `0.33fr` and `0.67fr`, as they’re more likely to behave as intended if tracks are added or removed.”

1. **Reminder: set `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons**

   The `aria-hidden="true"` attribute instructs the browser to *not* expose an element (and its children) to the accessibility API, which results in the element’s content not being announced to screen readers. This is useful in situations where an element contains “content that could be considered decorative, or duplicative, to equally accessible content that is rendered on the page.” For example, if a button contains an icon and text, then the icon is redundant and should be hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`.
