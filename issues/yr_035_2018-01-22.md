1. **Chrome’s `<dialog>` implementation is currently not fully keyboard accessible**

   The HTML `<dialog>` element, which is shown to the user as a modal dialog when its `showModal` method is invoked, has been supported in Chromium-based browsers for several years, and there’s an [official polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill) that works in all modern browsers and IE. 
   
   However, Chrome’s implementation does not follow the guidelines for keyboard accessibility defined in the [ARIA Authoring Practices specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#dialog_modal). Specifically, focus should *not* move outside of an active dialog, and when the dialog closes, focus should return to the element (button) that invoked the dialog.

   Until these issues in Chrome have been resolved ([the relevant bugs](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/954025660892237826)), consider using [A11y Dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/example/) instead. This library for modal dialogs is fully keyboard accessible, and you can use it in conjunction with ARIA attributes that convey the necessary semantics (`role="dialog"`, `aria-labelledby`, etc.).

1. **Firefox oversaturates colors on newer Apple computers**

   [![In Firefox, colors are more saturated than in Chrome](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/owthyc2a8jkklxd/chrome-firefox-colors.jpg?dl=0)](https://twitter.com/RamonTonnaer/status/941613555761270784)

   Apple’s iMac (since September 2015) and MacBook Pro (since October 2016) computers have wide-gamut displays that support the P3 color space (larger than the sRGB color space). Unlike Safari and Chrome, Firefox still doesn’t convert sRGB data to P3 (for CSS colors and images that lack color space information), which results in oversaturated colors. Hence, if you use Firefox for web development on a wide-gamut display, you may want to additionally test web page colors in a different browser to ensure correct results.

1. **Identifying the rendered font in Firefox and Chrome**

   In Firefox and Chrome, you can check which font is used for a given DOM element. In Firefox DevTools, when a DOM element is selected, the rendered font is underlined in the style inspector:

   Similarly, in Chrome DevTools, this information is located at the bottom of the *Computed* tab:

1. **Two-stage responsive layout with CSS Grid**

   In the second video of the new [Layout Land series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag/videos) (by Jen Simmons from Mozilla) about modern CSS layouts, there’s an example of a two-stage responsive grid layout (starts at 7:00). When a CSS `grid-template-column` (or `-row`) declaration contains both a `fr` and a `minmax()` value, then as the viewport becomes smaller, the `fr`-sized track shrinks to zero (the first stage), and only after that the `minmax()`-sized track starts shrinking from its specificed maximum to its minimum size (the second stage).
