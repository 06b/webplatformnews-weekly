1. **`await` works with arbitrary “thenables”**  
When the JavaScript `await` expression is executed with a promise, it returns the promise’s resolved value (once the promise resolves). In any other case, the `await` expression simply returns its operand unchanged, i.e. `(await x) === x`. However, if the operand happens to have a `then` method, it is treated as a promise, i.e. the operand’s `then` method’s `onFulfilled` callback is called implicitly.

1. **“First paint” marker in Chrome DevTools**  
After recording a profile in the Performance panel, the chart will include several vertical dashed lines; the blue line represents the `DOMContentLoaded` event, the red line the `load` event, and the green line the “First paint” time (hover over the handle at the top of a line, to see a tooltip with the line’s label)

1. **Interactive editor on MDN web docs**  
Mozilla has started beta-testing an interactive editor for CSS and JavaScript reference pages on MDN; the editor includes an “output” panel, and can be enabled on certain pages by adding `?v=b` to the page’s URL in the address bar

1. **The `<label>` element is not compatible with custom elements**  
Standard form controls (e.g. `<input type="checkbox">`) can be associated with a `<label>` element, which is beneficial for the following reasons: 1. the label provides the control’s “accessible name,” 2. clicking/tapping on the label focuses the control. Unfortunately, there’s currently no way to declare that a custom element is an interactive control, which means that a custom form control cannot be associated with the `<label>` element. In the 24. episode of A11ycasts, Rob Dodson suggests creating a custom label element to work around this limitation.

1. **Changes to implicit landmarks**  
Firefox Nightly has recently shipped the following WAI-ARIA 1.1 updates, which aim to make screen readers less chatty: 1. the `<section>` element is only announced as a region by assistive technologies if it has been explicitly named by the author (via ARIA or the `title` attribute), 2. the `<header>` and `<footer>` elements are only announced as regions if they are direct descendants of the `<body>` element

1. **CSS Values specification adds `min()` and `max()` functions**  
CSS now defines three math functions; the (pre-existing) `calc()` function contains a single mathematical calculation, while the new `min()` and `max()` functions contain a comma-separated list of mathematical calculations (which all must have the same “resolved type”)
