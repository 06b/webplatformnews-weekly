1. **Styling spelling and grammar mistakes**

   These are the proposed CSS features related to styling spelling and grammar errors:

   * The Text Decoration module defines the ([new](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/commit/d99566371e214f72d726574e5981e39685fb55b0)) `spelling-error` and `grammar-error` values for the [`text-decoration-line` property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-decor-3/#text-decoration-line-property). These values would allow web apps to re-use the browser‚Äôs default styles for highlighting spelling and grammar mistakes. For example, the  `text-decoration: spelling-error` declaration would be rendered as a red wavy underline in most browsers.

      ```css
      .misspelled {
          text-decoration: spelling-error;
      }
      ```

   * The Pseudo-Elements module defines the [`::spelling-error` and `::grammar-error` pseudo-elements](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-pseudo-4/#highlight-selectors), which represent the portions of text marked by the browser as misspelled or grammatically incorrect. These selectors would allow web apps to override the browser‚Äôs default styles for highlighting these types of mistakes (by applying a different `text-decoration` value).

      ```css
      ::spelling-error {
          text-decoration: underline dotted red;
      }
      ```

1. **Why Google Earth is Chrome-only for now**

   Earlier this year, the Google Earth team launched a web version of their legacy desktop application. This version relies on Chrome‚Äôs Native Client sandbox, which was chosen over Emscripten/asm.js for its better performance (‚Äúthanks to its native threading support‚Äù). The Earth team has since started working on porting the app from Native Client to WebAssembly. Unlike Native Client, [WebAssembly is cross-browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm), so the upcoming version of Google Earth is expected to work in all major browsers.

1. **The default `line-height` value differs across browsers**

   The Web Compatibility initiative [mentioned on Twitter](https://twitter.com/webcompat/status/918250862899691520) that the CSS `line-height` property defaults to the value `normal`, which differs across browsers. The spec advises browsers to chose ‚Äú[a ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô value based on the font of the element](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height).‚Äù Interestingly, browsers seem to use a slightly larger (about 10%, on average) default `line-height` value in their mobile versions.

1. **Set `width`/`height` on inline `<svg>` elements**

    Karl Dubost reminds that it‚Äôs a good idea to set a `width` attribute on inline SVG icons to prevent them from becoming oversized in case the page‚Äôs CSS is disabled or fails to load. The GitHub Blog also notes that ‚Äú[Internet Explorer needs defined `width` and `height` attributes](https://github.com/blog/2112-delivering-octicons-with-svg) on the `<svg>` element in order for them to be sized correctly.‚Äù
