1. **CSS `display: contents` removes elements from the accessibility tree in some browsers**

   When the [CSS `display: contents` value](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#valdef-display-contents) is applied to an element, the element is effectively replaced by its children. This feature can be useful in grid layouts, as it allows more deeply-nested elements to become grid items (e.g., the `<li>` children of a `<ul>` element inside a grid container), eliminating the need to flatten the contents of the grid container, which could make the markup less semantic. 

   The `contents` value is already [supported in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-display-contents), but the current implementations unfortunately remove an element’s implicit ARIA role when `display: contents` is applied to it (e.g., an `<ul>` element is no longer exposed as a `list` to <abbr title="assistive technologies">AT</abbr>). Until the relevant browser bugs have been fixed, consider [*not* using `display: contents` on elements with native semantics](https://twitter.com/AmeliasBrain/status/990967441244143616) (headings, sections, lists, etc.).

1. **Prefetching JavaScript modules that are likely to be needed later**

   Web apps can use [`<link rel="prefetch">`](https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/#prefetch) elements to ask the browser to prefetch resources that are likely to be needed in the future ([speculative resource prefetching](https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/#speculative-resource-prefetching-prefetch)). The browser will usually start fetching these resources after it has finished loading the web app’s other assets and entered the idle state.

   This feature can be used selectively to prefetch JavaScript modules that the web app is likely to load on demand (via the [`import()` method](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5684934484164608)) at a later time. In [version 4.6](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v4.6.0), webpack has introduced a control comment for the `import()` method (`/* webpackPrefetch: true */`) that instructs webpack to automatically inject the appropriate `<link rel="prefetch">` element into the page.

1. **Forcing an element on its own layer when animating it with JavaScript**

   The browser draws a web page’s elements onto composited layers. New layers are created for certain element types (e.g., `<canvas>`) and when certain CSS properties are applied to an element (e.g., 3D transforms). When an element is animated with JavaScript (e.g., via `requestAnimationFrame`), placing it on its own layer can help prevent excessive repaints. However, creating too many layers can have “[disastrous results on memory-constrained devices](https://webkit.org/blog/8262/visualizing-layers-in-web-inspector/).”

   There currently is no standard way to force an element on its own layer, but it can be achieved indirectly via the CSS `will-change` property or specific values such as `backface-visibility: hidden`. These approaches have different side effects, which are outlined in the article.
