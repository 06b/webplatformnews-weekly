1. **Use `tabindex="-1"` instead of `tabindex="0"` to make non-interactive elements focusable**

   Users can access (focus) the interactive elements on the page via the TAB key (see [focus navigation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#host_general_focus)). If an element isn’t focusable by default, you can [set `tabindex="0"`](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/08/using-the-tabindex-attribute/) to make it focusable, but this also inserts the element into the tab order. However, users generally expect only actionable controls (links, buttons, etc.) in the tab order, so including non-interactive elements such as headings may cause confusion. 

   Hence, it makes sense to set `tabindex="0"` only on *interactive* elements. For example, a `<div>` element can be turned into a [scrollable region](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2016/02/short-note-on-improving-usability-of-scrollable-regions/) via the `role="region"` and `tabindex="0"` attributes; this enables users to focus the element and scroll it with the keyboard. If you need to make a *non-interactive* element focusable, use `tabindex="-1"` instead; it makes the element programmatically focusable ([`focus` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus)) without inserting it into the tab order.

1. **A custom element for rendering inline 3D models that can be transformed with CSS**

   With the experimental `<x-model>` custom element, 3D models in the glTF or OBJ formats can be loaded and rendered inline on a web page (using three.js), and styled with CSS (incl. transforms and animations). Note that this solution is based on a  `<canvas>` element (for the WebGL renderer) that overlays the page and spans the entire viewport; the WebGL scene is currently re-rendered every frame but [the author plans to optimize performance](https://twitter.com/keithclarkcouk/status/994837307961331712).

1. **Don’t remove Opera Mini from the target browsers in your Browserslist config**

   Autoprefixer generates CSS vendor prefixes based on the web app’s Browserslist config (e.g., [the `browserslist` field in the project’s package.json file](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/autoprefixer-7-browserslist-2-released#how-to-use-browserslist)), which specifies the app’s supported browsers; the config currently defaults to `> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead`. (The browser usage statistics for `> 0.5%` and similar queries are provided by [StatCounter](http://gs.statcounter.com/).)

   A [widely-shared page](https://twitter.com/jamiebuilds/status/988559577313492992) claims that the `"last 2 versions"` option should be avoided. While this option should not be used alone, it works well when combined with other options such as `not dead`, which removes older browsers that no longer receive security updates (e.g., IE10). The page goes on to suggest that Opera Mini should be removed from the supported browsers entirely (`"not op_mini all"`). This is probably bad advice, since Opera Mini is still widely used in some regions of the world (100 million users in Africa).

   In response, the author of Autoprefixer and Browserslist has added a [Best Practices section](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#best-practices) to Browserslist’s README file, which now, among other things, warns against removing lesser-known browsers ([some people may not have other options](https://twitter.com/Browserslist/status/989994313538002950)).
