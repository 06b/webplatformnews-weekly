1. **What is Mozilla’s Project Things?**

   Mozilla is developing the Things Gateway, a software that enables users to monitor and control their connected devices directly from the web. The Internet of things (IoT) market is fragmented with each vendor creating their own proprietary solutions. This type of vendor lock-in results in high prices for consumers. Mozilla believes that connected devices should instead be based on open standards and frameworks.

   The user can run a Things Gateway on a Raspberry Pi (a single-board computer with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that costs around $35). Once booted (from an SD card), the gateway acts as a Wi-Fi hotspot and generates an SSL certificate (Let’s Encrypt) to connect to the Internet via a secure tunnel. Devices can then be added to the gateway via its web interface, which is a Progressive Web App. The Things Gateway works with “existing off-the-shelf smart home products from various different brands” ([supported hardware](https://github.com/mozilla-iot/wiki/wiki/Supported-Hardware)), and the latest release adds “an all-new add-on system for supporting new protocols and devices” (Zigbee and Z-Wave adapter add-ons are installed by default).

   In addition to being open, Things Gateway is evergreen (“gateway software should automatically keep itself up to date with over-the-air updates from Mozilla”) and focuses on privacy and security.

1. **MDN Web Docs performs language selection based on the `Accept-Language` header**

   Some websites perform language selection based on the user’s IP address, which can become a problem when the user travels to a country whose language they don’t understand ([this is a common complaint](https://twitter.com/DasSurma/status/893588422237073413)). An arguably better approach is implemented on MDN Web Docs: page requests with “locale-less” URLs (without “/en-US/” or similar in the URL’s path) are auto-redirected (via a `302 FOUND` response) to the relevant page in the user’s preferred language based on their HTTP `Accept-Language` request header. Protip: you can test different `Accept-Language` header values by setting the “intl.accept_languages” flag on the `about:config` page in Firefox.

   In addition to that, MDN Web Docs now allows users to explicitly declare their language preference ([stored in a session cookie](https://twitter.com/JakubBoucek/status/970287234585939968)), which then overrides their `Accept-Language` value whenever they load a locale-less URL on MDN. This new option is shown (via a dialog box) to the user when they select a language from the “Languages” menu at the top of the page.

   Side note: websites can also access the [`navigator.language` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/NavigatorLanguage/language), which “returns a string representing the preferred language of the user, usually the language of the browser UI.”

1. **CSS Shapes falls back nicely but isn’t used that much**

   The CSS `shape-outside` property can be used to define a non-rectangular shape (circle, custom polygon, etc.) that represents an element’s “float area,” which is used for wrapping (text) content around the element (e.g., image). This property is supported in Chrome and Safari, and is currently used on about 0.7% of page loads ([according to Chrome’s anonymous usage statistics](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/css/popularity)). Mozilla plans to ship CSS Shapes in Firefox later this year, alongside a [CSS Shapes Inspector](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew/status/964083748210905088) in Firefox Developer Tools.
