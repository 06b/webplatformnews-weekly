1. **An improved version of the `inert` attribute polyfill**

   The [HTML `inert` attribute](https://github.com/WICG/inert/blob/master/explainer.md) is a proposed Boolean attribute that enables web apps to more easily make parts of the DOM non-interactive (hidden from assistive technology and removed from the tab order, i.e., “un-tabbable” with a keyboard). This feature [greatly simplifies focus management](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/741404368063336448) (e.g., there’s no need to [set `tabindex="-1"` on each interactive element](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/741394307232436224) inside an inert DOM subtree). 
   
   The ability to make parts of the DOM inert is useful for temporary off-screen content (e.g., a side nav) that is kept in the DOM for performance reasons, but also for visible content that is non-interactive for various reasons (e.g., form content that is not currently relevant). An improved version of the `inert` attribute polyfill [removes all bundled polyfills](https://github.com/WICG/inert#legacy-browser-support) and [fixes several issues in IE11](https://github.com/WICG/inert/pull/94).

1. **Cancelling `fetch` requests with the Abort API**

   HTTP requests can be performed via the `XMLHttpRequest` constructor or the `fetch` method, but since `fetch` is based on promises, which don’t have a built-in aborting mechanism, only the older API supported cancelling requests until recently. Being unable to cancel a `fetch` request (in situations where the web app is no longer interested in the response) risks “[wasting bandwidth and battery, and causing additional latency](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/9vNZh4fhV2U/ZVxD2iQACgAJ).”

   The new Abort API ([`AbortController` and `AbortSignal` interfaces](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#aborting-ongoing-activities)), which is now supported in [all four major browser engines](https://caniuse.com/#feat=abortcontroller), enables web apps to cancel `fetch` requests, by passing an abort signal to the `fetch` call and then invoking the `abort` method on the associated abort controller. (A single abort signal can be [used for multiple fetches](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/abortable-fetch#one_signal_many_fetches).)

1. **Customized built-in elements have shipped in Chrome**

   [Customized built-in elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example) — as opposed to the more common “autonomous custom elements” — enable authors to extend built-in HTML elements with custom functionality (e.g., [`<button is="fancy-button">`](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements#extendhtml)). Since these elements retain the original local name (e.g., `button`), they automatically inherit the semantics and behavior of the built-in element (i.e., there’s [no need to re-implement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-autonomous-drawbacks) these aspects).

   Until this feature is more widely supported — Firefox’s implementation is expected to ship by the end of the year, and the Edge team will [post a roadmap update](https://medium.com/@kylealden/hi-andreas-thanks-for-sharing-your-thoughts-96d37c02b894) soon — it can be easily polyfilled ([document-register-element](https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element) is only 5.4 KB!). Note that Apple remains opposed to using the `is` attribute to extend built-in elements: “[we don’t think [it’s] the right approach](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/509#issuecomment-266174073).”
