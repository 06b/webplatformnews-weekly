1. **`/./su` matches any Unicode character**

   In JavaScript regular expressions: 1. the `u` flag makes the `.` operator, quantifiers, and character classes compatible with astral characters (U+010000–U+10FFFF) such as emoji; 2. the `s` flag (a new ECMAScript feature available via a [Babel plugin](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-dotall-regex)) makes `.` match any character, including line terminators.

1. **Firefox delays tracking scripts during page load**

   When a web page requests scripts from domains that are in Mozilla’s Tracking Protection database, Firefox will now delay the load of such scripts for a few seconds to improve the loading performance of the website’s own sub-resources. This new behavior only affects tracking scripts that were added dynamically or marked as `async`.

1. **Windows will handle push messages in the background**

   “Notifications in Microsoft Edge and PWAs will be integrated in the Windows Action Center. If a user receives a notification and didn’t get the chance to act on it, it will get tucked away into Action Center for later, so notifications never get left unseen.” The next Windows 10 update (codenamed “Redstone 4”) is expected in March.

1. **WebAIM’s screen reader user survey**

   Screen reader users navigate headings to find information on a lengthy web page and overwhelmingly use a screen reader on mobile devices. One of the biggest issues for screen reader users is when “screens or parts of screens change unexpectedly.”

1. **Update on TLS 1.3**

   TLS 1.3 is the largest change to the protocol in its history. Google, Mozilla, Facebook, Cloudflare, and others have spent the last year trying to determine to what degree TLS 1.3 has to be disguised as TLS 1.2, so that servers and middleboxes don’t cause connections to fail. “The new ‘middlebox-friendly’ changes … were incorporated into the specification in TLS 1.3 Draft 22.”
