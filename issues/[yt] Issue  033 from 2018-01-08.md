1. **BBC’s web pages are assembled by nanoservices**

   BBC uses over 1000 independent components (they call them nanoservices) to create the individual parts of their web pages (e.g., about 30 nanoservices help create components on the BBC News homepage). The nanoservices are written in JavaScript (running in Node.js) and use React to render HTML. BBC uses a pseudo-serverless approach: nanoservices are executed on demand (via a RESTful API), and communication between nanoservices is handled internally via a low-latency message bus (powered by Redis). BBC hopes to make their platform open source in the future.

1. **Permission prompts in Chrome for Android no longer dismissable**

   When a website triggers a permission prompt (to access the user’s location, send notifications, etc.), Chrome for Android now forces the user to choose between “Block” and “Allow” (the user can no longer dismiss the prompt by simply closing it like in other mobile browsers). This change shouldn’t affect websites that follow the best practice of only requesting permissions *after* the user has shown intent ([see examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WNPIS_2F0eyDm5SS2E6LZ_75tk6XtBSnR1xNjWJ_DPE/edit)).

1. **An alternative to CSS `object-fit` that works in IE**

   When an image needs to be displayed inside a box whose aspect ratio doesn’t match the aspect ratio of the image, the CSS `object-fit` property can be used to scale the image down so that it fits inside the box (`contain` value), or to scale the image up so that it completely fills the box (`cover` value; the part of the image that overflows the box is clipped). IE does not support this CSS property, but there is an alternative using inline SVG that works in IE9 and up. Note that this solution requires that the image’s intrinsic dimensions are specified in the `<svg viewBox>` attribute.

1. **New performance and SEO audits in Lighthouse**

   Lighthouse in Chrome Canary (the *Audits* panel in DevTools) now includes the three new performance audits introduced in version 2.6 and the all-new SEO audits introduced in version 2.7. The “JavaScript boot-up time” audit measures the parsing and evaluation time of each script included on the web page. The other new performance audits identify static assets with inefficient cache policies (HTTP `Cache-Control` header) and delays introduced by page redirects.

1. **Only one visible `<main>` element per web page**

   The `<main>` element represents the most important content of a web page. This element *cannot* be used contextually to label the main parts of an `<article>` or `<section>` element. Hence, there must only be one visible `<main>` element in the DOM—this rule is beneficial to screen reader users, and the WHATWG HTML Standard is expected to adopt it.
