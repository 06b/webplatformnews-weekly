1. **The recommended way to mark up the subtitle of a heading**

   Headings (`<h1>`–`<h6>` elements) introduce new sections and subsections ([some sections are implicit](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#headings-and-sections)), so it’s incorrect to use a heading of a lower rank to mark up a subtitle, which “merely elaborates on the main title at the same level.” A sound document structure is important for assistive technology users.

   The W3C HTML specification provides [multiple examples](https://w3c.github.io/html/common-idioms-without-dedicated-elements.html#subheadings-subtitles-alternative-titles-and-taglines) of how to mark up subtitles and taglines (this section is not included in the WHATWG version of the HTML spec). The two suggested approaches are:

1. **Invoking the array `map` method with an async callback returns an array of promises**

   Note: I will try to explain the pattern shown in the screenshot below, which appeared in a [recent video by Jake Archibald](https://youtu.be/bfxglBVSNDI) (I’m not necessarily recommending this pattern; [see alternatives](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/1005536660019347456)). Given an array of file objects, the goal is to retrieve the sizes of all files in parallel and pause execution until the total file size has been computed.

   ![Performing array `map` iteration with an async function](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jcyltb47jsj9j2k/array-iteration-method-with-async-function.png?dl=0)

   An async function always returns a promise that resolves to the function’s actual return value. In this case, the async function is passed to the array `map` method, so it is invoked once for each array element, in sequence. Each invocation initiates the `getSize` operation and then immediately returns a promise that resolves once function execution completes (i.e., once the `getSize` promise *itself* resolves, and the retrieved file size is added to the total). Hence, the return value of the original `map` method invocation is an array of promises. These promises resolve to the value `undefined`, since the async function does not explicitly return anything (no `return` statement), but the promise resolutions *per se* signify that their associated file sizes have been added to the total.

1. **Insufficient color contrast cannot be reliably detected with automated tools**

   Insufficient color contrast is the [most common accessibility issue on the Web](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/999901471515688960). WCAG’s [“Contrast (Minimum)” success criterion](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) states that the contrast ratio of text should be at least 4.5:1 (no higher than `#767676` on a white background, according to [contrast-ratio.com](http://contrast-ratio.com/)), and 3:1 for [large-scale text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-large-scale) (no higher than `#949494`).

   You can use tools such as Lighthouse and aXe to check for color contrast issues on a web page, but these automated tools are unable to detect insufficient color contrast in cases where the [background is an image, gradient, or texture](https://codepen.io/aardrian/full/ZLZMep/). To ensure that text placed over an image remains legible and readable, you can insert a [semi-transparent gradient or blur effect](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-over-images/) between the text and the background.
