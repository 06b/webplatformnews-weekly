1. **Debugging CSS custom properties**

   CSS custom properties are now widely supported (‚ûî [‚Ññ 881](https://webplatform.news/issues/2017-04-21#css-custom-properties-and-css-supports-)). Firefox and Safari‚Äôs developer tools include features (in the Rules pane) that help with debugging them:
   
      1. When hovering over a `var()` function, the specified value of the custom property is displayed in a tooltip.
      2. Nonexistent custom properties are marked. (Note that referencing a nonexistent custom property is fine, as long as a fallback value is provided, e.g. `var(--scale, 1)`.)

1. **Potential Web Components features**

   Rob Dodson from Google has created an opinion poll,  which asks developers to vote on which (low-level) Web Components features should be prioritized next, including:

      * a way do declare an element‚Äôs shadow DOM in the HTML markup, which would enable server-rendering of web components,
      * a way to define default styles for a custom element (via the `:host` selector, ‚ûî [‚Ññ 947](https://webplatform.news/issues/2017-08-17#style-encapsulation-with-shadow-dom)) without having to create a shadow root,
      * fully isolated components, which would offer ‚Äúsecurity guarantees in both directions‚Äù (the component and embedding document could not access each other‚Äôs DOM or script state in any way).

1. **Chrome‚Äôs Field Trials platform**

   Chrome uses Field Trials for experimentation, and feature rollouts:

   > Where possible, Chrome rolls out new features dynamically using the Field Trials platform. You can think of Field Trials as a set of server-controlled flags that allow Google to change Chrome‚Äôs behavior dynamically, at runtime, without shipping a new version.

1. **MDN Web Docs becomes a cross-browser documentation**

   Microsoft, Google, Samsung, and the W3C have reached an agreement to collaborate in making Mozilla‚Äôs MDN Web Docs a ‚Äúbrowser-agnostic‚Äù documentation, and the definitive documentation for web developers. Microsoft added a column for Edge to MDN‚Äôs compatibility tables, and has now [started redirecting MSDN pages to MDN](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/18/documenting-web-together-mdn-web-docs/), while Chrome has already been [transitioning its web documentation efforts to MDN](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/10/building-unified-documentation-for-web.html) for the last several years.

1. **Payment Request API in Chrome for iOS**

   Apple is expected to ship the Payment Request API in Safari [in the near future](https://webkit.org/status/#feature-payment-request). Until then, Google has decided to support this API in Chrome for iOS (which is WebKit-based) via a custom implementation (‚Äúit is possible to add extra APIs to the WebKit webview included in iOS‚Äù). Note that Chrome uses the credit cards stored in the user‚Äôs Google account for this feature.

1. **Some types of functions are not constructable**

   In JavaScript, some types of functions including arrow functions, async functions, and functions created using the method shorthand syntax, are not constructable, and thus cannot be used with the `new` operator.
