1. **Regexly**  
This web tool lets you enter a regular expression and a string, and then displays the result (return value) of calling the four relevant JavaScript methods (String `search` and `match`, and RegExp `test` and `exec` methods) with these values.

1. **Avoiding `git push --force` disasters**  
Performing a `git push --force` into a remote branch can overwrite you teammates‚Äô latest work. Andrey Novikov explains how you can recover from such a mistake, and what you can do to avoid it in the first place. Specifically, you can use the `--force-with-lease` option instead, and you can protect certain branches on GitHub (which disables force pushing, among other things).

1. **Using ECMAScript modules in Node.js**  
If you update Node.js to version 8.5, and run it with the `--experimental-modules` option, you can start using ECMAScript modules (`import`/`export` syntax) in your Node.js apps. These modules need to have the `.mjs` file extension, and can‚Äôt use the `__dirname` variable, but they can import CJS modules (e.g. `import _ from 'lodash';`).

1. **JavaScript `do` expressions**  
This feature is now an official proposal in the TC39 process (currently at Stage 1). A `do` expression enables executing a block of statements in an expression context (think of it as an [IIFE with better syntax](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/911950981943963649)), which can be useful when initializing local variables or in JSX code (see the proposal for code examples).

1. **Firefox for Android displays the base domain**  
The URL bar in Firefox Nightly for Android has been improved. The URL has become scrollable, and Firefox initially centers it on the base domain. This seems to be a protective measure against phishing websites.

1. **Sonar**  
Microsoft has recently open-sourced their Sonar linting tool (the code now belongs to the JS Foundation), and is welcoming feedback and participation from the community. Sonar integrates existing linting tools such as axe, SSL Labs, and Snyk, and it‚Äôs available as a command line (npm) tool, while an online version and a VS Code plugin is in development.
