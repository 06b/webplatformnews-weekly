1. **VoiceOver does not recognize `<footer>` as a `contentinfo` landmark**

   According to the “ARIA in HTML” specification, a web page’s `<footer>` element has an [implicit ARIA role of `contentinfo`](https://w3c.github.io/html-aria/#footer), which identifies the element as landmark that contains information about the web page (“such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like”). Landmarks allow screen reader users to more easily navigate the page. For example, in Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader, the user can quickly access landmarks through the Web rotor feature:

   ![VoiceOver’s Web rotor lists a web page’s landmarks](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/g3ljp54ktb9rcjy/voiceover-rotor-landmarks.png?dl=0)

   Normally, a web page should *not* use the `role` attribute to reaffirm an element’s implicit ARIA semantics (“[First rule of ARIA use](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/#rule1),” e.g., write `<nav>` instead of `<nav role=”navigation”>`). However, since VoiceOver currently does not correctly recognize a web page’s `<footer>` element as a landmark, consider writing `<footer role=”contentinfo”>` until this issue is resolved ([the relevant bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146930)).

   Side note: to list a web page’s landmarks in Safari, open VoiceOver with command + F5, press control + option + U to access the rotor, and then use the right arrow key to reach “Landmarks” (you may have to enable this item in VoiceOver Utility).

1. **You can check how Google renders your web pages**

   The Google Search crawler renders pages [with some limitations](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/rendering): a number of APIs, including IndexedDB and Service Workers, are disabled, while cookies and web storage are cleared between page loads. Also, the rendering engine is based on Chrome 41 (released in March 2015), so modern JavaScript (ES6+) and some newer CSS features (e.g., custom properties, grid layout) aren’t supported. (I recommend using [Babel’s env preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-env/).)

   Add your website to Google’s Search Console (if you already haven’t) and use the [“Fetch as Google” tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6066468?hl=en) to test how Google renders your website’s pages (“you have a daily quota of 10 fetches”).

1. **Auto margins take precedence over box alignment in grid and flex layouts**

   By default, grid items are stretched on both axes, while flex items are stretched on the cross axis and packed toward the start of the line on the main axis. Grid and flex items can be aligned via box alignment properties, such as  `justify-content` and `align-self`, but also via auto margins, which “absorb positive free space prior to alignment via the box alignment properties.”
