1. **The CSS Working Group has approved the `clamp()` function**

   The `clamp()` function has been added as the [fourth mathematical expression](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#calc-notation) (the other three are `calc()`, `min()`, and `max()`) to the CSS Values and Units module; it’s equivalent to using `min()` and `max()` in combination: `clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX)` is equivalent to `max(MIN, min(VAL, MAX))` (the `VAL` calculation is clamped according to the `MIN` and `MAX` calculations).

   This proposed feature could be used to simplify [CSS locks](https://fvsch.com/code/css-locks/); e.g., `font-size: clamp(20px, calc(10px + 3.125vw), 40px)` defines a text size that grows from its minimum value of `20px` to its maximum value of `40px` as the viewport width increases from `320px` to `960px`. In the [original demo](https://fvsch.com/code/css-locks/demo1), three `font-size` declarations (two of which inside `@media` rules) are required to achieve this effect:

1. **KaiOS has quickly become the second most popular mobile OS in India**

   New “[web phones](https://twitter.com/scottjenson/status/993124205158776832)” based on KaiOS (e.g., [JioPhone](https://www.kaiostech.com/kaios-transforms-indian-market-launch-jiophone/)) are being sold in India. KaiOS is a mobile operating system [optimized for low-memory feature phones](https://www.kaiostech.com/4g-lte-cost-kaios-advantage-feature-phones/) that uses Mozilla’s Gecko layout engine, and [supports service workers and push notifications](https://twitter.com/KaiOStech/status/993359863748046849).

   KaiOS devices include apps based on HTML (incl. Facebook and Google Assistant) and a [curated app store](https://twitter.com/firt/status/995274758924226560) (they say it will be “relatively easy” to convert a web app to KaiOS). According to a recent [report from DeviceAtlas](https://mobiforge.com/research-analysis/latest-deviceatlas-report-feature-phone-use-still-widespread), “KaiOS has already overtaken iOS as the second most used OS in India. With 15% of total traffic, it beats Apple devices into third (with 9.6%).”

1. **New and updated performance metrics in Lighthouse version 3**

   The performance metrics in Lighthouse (the *Audits* panel in DevTools) have been changed in version 3 (available in Chrome Canary) as follows: (1) First Contentful Paint has been added (“the time at which the first text/image is painted”), (2) First Interactive has been renamed to First CPU Idle (“the first time at which the page’s main thread is quiet enough to handle input”), (3) Perceptual Speed Index has been renamed to Speed Index and aligned with how WebPageTest measures this metric.
