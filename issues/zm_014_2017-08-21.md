1. **Chrome Custom Tabs for installed web apps**  
The following change is coming to the next version of Chrome for Android: ‚ÄúWhen navigating from an installed web app to a site outside the initial web app‚Äôs scope, the new site now automatically loads in a Custom Chrome Tab‚Äù (instead of in the full Chrome browser); I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference in terms of loading performance, however, the Custom Tab has a üû™ (cross) button in the upper left corner, which, when tapped, returns the user to the installed web app
