1. Autoprefixer 7.2 improves CSS Grid support for IE and introduces an `autoprefixer-info` CLI tool: **1.** When you **place grid items with `grid-area`**, Autoprefixer will create the appropriate `-ms-` prefixes for IE (Autoprefixer’s `grid` option has to be enabled). **2. Run `npx autoprefixer-info`** (no separate installation required) in your project’s directory to view a list of all browser versions that your project supports as well as a list of all CSS at-rules, selectors, properties, and values that are prefixed by Autoprefixer, based on the project’s config ([example output](https://gist.github.com/simevidas/d50844d62bb0714858d46ada33353231)).

1. A new note in the CSS Box Alignment Module highlights that in a flexbox layout, when `flex-direction` is set to `column` or `column-reverse` (and only then), the `justify-*` properties align items on the block axis, which is an exception. In all other layout modes, **`justify-*` operates on the inline axis**.

1. The (in-development) **WebXR Device API** ([explainer](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/master/explainer.md)) replaces the WebVR API: “WebXR 1.0, which will supersede WebVR entirely, will deliver broad device support for headsets and browsers starting in Q1 2018” ([status](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5680169905815552)).
