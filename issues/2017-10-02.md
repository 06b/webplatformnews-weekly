1. **`<web-torrent>`, `<mark-down>`, `<roll-call>`**  
Mikeal Rogers has created several web components, that are also available in standalone versions on the jsDelivr CDN. These versions bundle a script that dynamically loads the necessary web components polyfills, with the intention to make it easier to add the web component to a web page via a single `<script>` element.

1. **webextension-polyfill**  
You can create browser extensions that work in both Chrome and Firefox with Mozilla‚Äôs polyfill, which allows you to use the promise-based WebExtensions API instead of Chrome‚Äôs callback-based API.

1. **Interactive treeview with `<details>`**  
The symbol ‚Äú‚ñ∫‚Äù is [frequently used as anchor text](https://discuss.httparchive.org/t/the-most-frequently-used-anchor-text/1071) inside treeview widgets on websites such as Blogger. However, such an interactive treeview can be implemented without JavaScript, by nesting `<details>` elements instead. The `<details>` element is currently not supported in Edge, but it‚Äôs [in development](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/detailssummary/), and it works with a polyfill, after making [a few adjustments](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/915329395631501312).

1. **CSS Grid Playground**  
I recommend Rachel Andrew's [‚ÄúGrid by Example‚Äù video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz9BzY21Zks&list=PLQkVA6z3dFvbnBJetfYDAF3-cG_ubgdZR) (a set of 19 short screencasts) for learning the fundamentals of CSS Grid Layout. If you prefer a non-video format, you will find this new guide created by Dan Brown for Mozilla useful.

1. **Access to the URL in standalone PWAs**  
If a Progressive Web App specifies `"display": "standalone"` in its web app manifest, the browser‚Äôs URL bar is not displayed when the app is launched from the home screen. In order to give the user access to the web app‚Äôs current URL, Chrome Canary for Android now provides a notification with the available actions ‚ÄúShare‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpen in chrome‚Äù in the notification drawer whenever the standalone PWA is in the foreground.

1. **AMP `<amp-position-observer>` element**  
The AMP library has added a custom element that provides functionality similar to the Intersection Observer API (‚ûî [‚Ññ 939](https://webplatform.news/issues/2017-08-03#intersection-observer-options)). The new element enables performant scroll-bound animations in AMP (e.g. subtle zoom or fade in of images).
