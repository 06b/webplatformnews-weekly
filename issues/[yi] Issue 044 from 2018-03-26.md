1. **AMP pages are lightweight because AMP disallows custom JavaScript**

   On Google Search, AMP pages load almost instantly. This is because (*a*) they’re preloaded in the background, and (*b*) they load from Google AMP Cache, which performs a series of optimizations (incl. on-the-fly image compression and automatic inclusion of resource hints).

   Most AMP pages have a separate canonical page, a regular (non-AMP) web page with equivalent content (see [Google’s policy on content parity with AMP](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2017/11/engaging-users-through-high-quality-amp.html)). When comparing AMP pages to their associated canonical pages, the most striking difference is that AMP pages are significantly lighter (905 KB vs. 2,762 KB) and load significantly fewer assets (61 vs. 318 requests). (All numbers are median values from testing 50 pages.)

   This is mainly because [AMP disallows author-written JavaScript](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/spec) (incl. third-party scripts): “It’s a concession publishers are willing to make in exchange for the enhanced distribution Google provides [Top Stories carousel on Google Search], but that they hesitate to make for their canonical versions.”

1. **Screen readers do not match the CSS `speech` media type**

   The CSS Media Queries module defines four [media types](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-4/#media-types): `all`, `print`, `screen`, and `speech`. This specification has recently been updated with a note that clarifies that screen readers match the `screen` media type (i.e., browsers don’t switch from `screen` to `speech` when a screen reader is active), while the `speech` media type is meant exclusively for “user agents that produce an audio rendition of the document, without any reference to a 2D visual layout” (pure-audio user agents).

1. **Certificate Transparency enforcement in Chrome starts on April 30**

   Browsers have a list of certificate authorities (CAs) that they trust (e.g., Firefox trusts 160 CAs). Any certificate authority can issue any certificate for any website. This system is vulnerable to attacks on CAs and CA misbehavior.

   “The goal of Certificate Transparency (CT) is to make all certificates public so that mis-issued certificates can be detected and appropriate action taken.” Websites can use a (free) CT monitoring service to get notified when a new certificate is found for their domain (this can alert them of mis-issuance).
   
   Chrome will require all new certificates [issued after April 30](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/ct-policy/wHILiYf31DE/iMFmpMEkAQAJ) to be “CT qualified” (an embedded assurance that the certificate has been added to CT logs).
