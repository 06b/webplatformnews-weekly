1. **Multicolor borders and outlines**

   The CSS Backgrounds 4 module (which is marked as “not ready for implementation”) now allows defining [multicolor borders](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-4/#the-border-color) by providing a comma-separated list of `<color>` values (see the spec example). This feature will also apply to outlines, according to a [recent CSS WG resolution](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1172#issuecomment-295565255), and it could be used to [improve the accessibility of focus indicators](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1172#issuecomment-292811702) (“providing two colors side by side on the outline would ensure it’s always visible”).

   ```css
   outline: 3px solid;
   outline-color: black, white; /* the outline is split into equal-width bands of each color */
   ```

1. **CSS Scrollbars module**

   This ([new](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77790#c214)) [CSS spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scrollbars-1/) aims to standardize a set of `scrollbar-*-color` properties for styling the color of scrollbars. The initial proposal is based on the properties introduced (and supported only) in IE, although the list “is likely to be reduced to 2–3 (ideally 2), with current candidates being `scrollbar-base-color`, `scrollbar-face-color`, and `scrollbar-track-color`.”
   
   Note that Chrome and Safari support non-standard pseudo-elements, [`::-webkit-scrollbar`, etc.](https://webkit.org/blog/363/styling-scrollbars/), for styling scrollbars. Jet Villegas‏ from Mozilla has recently [asked for feedback](https://twitter.com/junglecode/status/923322550758752256) on Twitter.

1. **A grid item fills its grid area by default**

   A grid area is the area occupied by a grid item. The default grid area is a single grid cell, but it can be any rectangular set of adjacent grid cells (this is controlled by the item’s “grid span,” which can be set to an integer larger than `1` in either axis). By default, a [grid item fills its grid area](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/917782458254417921) (it stretches to the grid area’s size)<sup>*</sup>, but the item can also be set to a smaller size and then aligned within its grid area [via the `justify-self` and `align-self` properties](https://css-tricks.com/grid-areas-element-occupies-arent-necessarily-size/).

   <sup>*</sup> The exception to this rule are elements with an intrinsic aspect ratio or an intrinsic size (e.g.,  images), which are `start`-aligned by default.
