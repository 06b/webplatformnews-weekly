1. **Developers can proactively submit Progressive Web Apps to the Microsoft Store**

   The Microsoft Edge browser will add support for service workers in the impending Windows 10 update (named “Spring Creators Update”). In preparation for this update, Microsoft has started “crawling and indexing quality PWAs from the Web to list them in the [Microsoft Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Store_(digital))” with the intention to make them “first-class app citizens in Windows” (they will be listed in the Store alongside native apps). Hence, users will be able to find PWAs in the Microsoft Store, install them (“packaged as an AppX”), and use them (“running in their own sandboxed container”) without ever opening the browser ([example](https://twitter.com/kirupa/status/959175077836111872)). Installed PWAs will also have access to local contacts (with permission), among other things.

   Developers can proactively submit PWAs to the Microsoft Store*, by “generating an AppX containing your PWA and publishing it to your Dev Center account … Once in the Store, the publisher will have the option of claiming their apps to take complete control of their Store presence.” Note that the AppX package can be generated, based on an existing website with a web app manifest, with Microsoft’s [PWA Builder tool](https://preview.pwabuilder.com/).

   *There seems to be a one-time registration fee of approx. $19 for creating a Microsoft Developer account (for individuals), which enables you to publish apps to the Store.

1. **Why CSS can’t add pseudo-classes that depend on layout**

   The [CSS Working Group Wiki](https://wiki.csswg.org/main) now includes a FAQ section that explains why some commonly requested features cannot be added to CSS. Among these features are selectors that depend on layout.
   
   It would be useful to have an `:overflown` pseudo-class to select elements that overflow (when an element’s contents extend outside of the element’s box), or a `:stuck` pseudo-class to select elements that are “stuck” (when a [stickily positioned element](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#sticky-pos) is offset from its normal flow position). However, these selectors depend on layout.
   
   A style rule can modify layout, so if a selector depends on layout, it is possible to create a circular dependency that results in an infinite loop ([example using the `:hover` pseudo-class](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/969245859329257472)). This circularity is what’s [preventing container queries from being standardized](https://github.com/WICG/cq-usecases/wiki/Circularity-and-Container-Queries), and it’s the reason why CSS won’t add pseudo-classes that depend on layout.

1. **Facebook’s “Navigation Assistant” menubar**

   A [“skip to main content” link](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/) is an invisible link (only visible when it receives keyboard focus) at the top of the page (the first focusable element on the page) that allows keyboard users and users with motor disabilities to easily and quickly reach the main content of the page.

   Facebook’s website includes a “navigation assistant” menubar ([ARIA `role="menubar"` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#menu)) that functions like a skip link, but to a greater degree and with added functionality. It contains two menus: one for jumping to different sections of the page—“it extends landmark navigation to all keyboard users, not just those using assistive technologies”—and another one for navigating to other pages on Facebook.
   
   The entire menubar acts as a single “tab stop,” and the user moves between menus and selects menu items via arrow keys. The user can also access the menubar from anywhere on Facebook by pressing Alt + / (Option + / on Mac).
