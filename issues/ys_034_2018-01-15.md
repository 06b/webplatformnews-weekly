1. **A global option to block permission requests is coming to Firefox**

   Web apps can ask for various permissions (location access, sending notifications, etc.) via permission prompts. Mozilla plans to introduce an option in Firefox (on desktop) that would allow users to permanently deny all future permission requests of a certain type. For example, if the user enables “Block new requests asking to access your location,” every web page that calls `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` will automatically get a `"User denied geolocation prompt"` error, just as if the user clicked “Deny” in the permission prompt. Notice that after enabling this option, the user is *no longer notified* when a web page requests this permission. The four permission types for which this option will be available in Firefox are: Location, Camera, Microphone, and Notifications.

   [According to Alex Russell](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/950437696324845568), Chrome may at some point start blocking permission prompts on websites with low accept rates. This would become another case of the web page getting a “User denied” error without the user interacting with the permission prompt.

1. **What is Safari’s upcoming Storage Access API?**

   When multiple websites load resources from the same third party (e.g., by embedding widgets from Facebook), that third party is able to track users (using cookies) across these websites. Safari has a feature called [“Intelligent Tracking Prevention”](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/) that allows third parties to use cookies for cross-site tracking *only* if the user has interacted with that third party directly (by visiting its website) in the last 24 hours. Otherwise, these cookies are *partitioned* (per embedding website) or even purged to prevent cross-site tracking.

   [Safari 11.1](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_11_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014305-CH14-SW7) will introduce a Storage Access API that will allow third parties in cross-origin iframes to get access to their (partitioned) cookies, on user interaction and if certain rules are fulfilled. This will allow embedded third parties (e.g., commenting widgets) to use their cookies for authentication.

1. **CSS `display: contents` false positive in Safari**

   The [new CSS `display: contents` value](https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2018/01/11/display-contents-is-coming/)—supported in Firefox and coming to Chrome 65 and Safari 11.1 sometime next month—will be useful in CSS grid layouts, by [allowing elements that are not siblings to participate in the same grid layout together](https://css-tricks.com/get-ready-for-display-contents/). However, Safari already supports [`display: contents` on `<slot>` elements](https://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css#L1201), but applying it on other elements results in the `display: inline` value. If you plan on using the `@supports (display: contents)` feature query, note that it results in a false positive in versions of Safari prior to 11.1.

1. **Focusing on the slowest 1% of requests**

   Wikipedia performs real user monitoring (RUM) via JavaScript code that sends Navigation Timing measurements to the web server. When analyzing that data, Wikimedia’s performance team focuses on the highest 1% of response times (the values in the 99th percentile), which, counterintuitively, could affect 20% of page views and 60% of users in their case: “A problem with 1% of requests is a serious problem … This is like rolling dice in a game. With a 16% (⅙) chance of rolling a six, if everyone keeps rolling, everyone should get a six eventually.”
