1. **Twitter’s “Do Not Track” option for websites**  
If you’re embedding Twitter widgets on your website, consider adding the `<meta name="twitter:dnt" content="on">` tag to your web pages. It instructs Twitter to *not* record which pages of your website your visitors are viewing (Twitter uses this data for “personalization”). Note that Twitter does not honor the `DNT` header (see [issue 2017-05-29](https://github.com/simevidas/webplatformnews-weekly/blob/master/issues/2017-05-29.md)).

1. **Mozilla’s open-source commenting platform**  
It’s called “Talk,” it’s developed by The Coral Project, and it’s now used by the Washington Post on parts of their website (Politics, Business, and Tech sections). The Coral Project’s lead says, that they’ve learned—through academic studies and workshops—how to turn comments into “a productive space for everyone.”

1. **Colorblind fail and success cases**  
The article provides “practical examples of how design can hurt or help users with color vision deficiencies.” The general advice is to use text labels, to ensure that charts and controls are accessible to people even if they have difficulties identifying colors or telling colors apart.

1. **Google AdWords announces AMP landing pages**  
AdWords advertisers are enticed to convert their ad landing pages to AMP, since those pages will be cached by Google AMP Cache in that case (the rollout begins later this month): “As a result, advertisers who use AMP pages as ad landing pages in Adwords can expect those landing pages to load near-instantly.”

1. **Tabular view for SVG charts**  
An SVG data visualization can be made more accessible to screen readers by adding table semantics to the SVG code via the ARIA `table`, `row`, `columnheader`, `rowheader`, and `cell` roles. Such a solution, however, isn’t fully supported in all the browser and screen reader combinations, which is why Léonie Watson suggests providing an alternative, tabular view of the content: “Letting people choose between a graphical and tabular view of the data would be a good thing to do in any case.”
