1. **Installed Progressive Web Apps can now become share targets on Android**

   A Progressive Web App that is installed on Android (“Add to home screen”) through Chrome Canary*, can now become a share target, which means that the web app [appears as an option](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/989209483695087617) when the user opens the sharing feature in other Android apps. In order to become a share target, the PWA has to specify a [`"share_target"` URL template](https://wicg.github.io/web-share-target/#share_target-member) in its web application manifest (e.g., see [Twitter Lite’s manifest](https://gist.github.com/simevidas/8d578c87d6ae54fcf8fad0d208e92acc)).

   This also makes it possible to [share data between two installed web apps](https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/989903055377387520), directly; the first app uses the Web Share API (`navigator.share` method), and the second app uses the Web Share Target API (`"share_target"` field).

   <small>*The Web Share Target API is still in development and is not available in the stable version of Chrome yet.</small>

1. **Layered APIs would reduce the need for libraries by incorporating fallback URLs**

   The [Extensible Web Manifesto](https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/) (2013) asks browsers to focus on adding new low-level APIs to the web platform, allowing developers to create high-level features on top of these APIs in JavaScript. After enough experimentation, development and iteration, these high-level features could be implemented in browsers and standardized. This is a better system than having high-level features standardized and shipped in browsers *before* they receive any significant feedback from developers.

   However, developers often prefer using libraries over high-level features that are not widely supported: “it’s rarely seen as worthwhile to go through the feature-detection dance if you have to write the fallback code anyway.” The proposed Layered APIs infrastructure introduces a new syntax for importing specific web platform features (as JavaScript modules) that allows developers to provide fallback URLs (e.g., a polyfill on a public CDN). By using features that are available as layered APIs (e.g., `async-local-storage`), a web app could reduce the amount of JavaScript it loads.

1. **Lighthouse now reports when a web page includes JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities**

   When examining a web page in Lighthouse (the Audits panel in Chrome DevTools), there is now a “front-end JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities” audit in the Best Practices section. Clicking on an identified library opens a page on Snyk’s website with more information about that library’s known vulnerabilities (incl. available patches). If no patch is available for a vulnerability, you can click on it to check in which version of the library it was fixed.
